Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>',frontmatter:{title:"My second blog article",author:"Argi Avetisyan",date:"21 April, 2018"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/second-blog-post/"}}}});
