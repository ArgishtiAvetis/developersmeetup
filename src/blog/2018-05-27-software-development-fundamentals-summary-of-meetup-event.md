### Where & How to Learn

- Youtube, `Udemy` (~$10/course), `Lynda.com`, `EdX`
- Your `local library` (some branches also provide free Lynda.com access ^_^)
- Computer Science Fundamentals (`Harvards’ CS50`)  
- Code every day, at least for 1 - 2 hours
- Work for FREE
- Offer your friends to make a website for them for free and `build a portfolio`
- Don’t be embarrassed! `Share your code on Github` (it landed me a job)
