What was covered during the Meetup:

- What React can and can not do
- React.JS fundamental concepts, State, Props
- Live React.JS coding, examples, core concepts in practice
- Building a Job Board using React and Github Jobs API (adding it to LACoders.tech?)
- MobX, state management theory (this will covered during next meetings)

`React` is a an open-source Javascript library for building user interfaces. The group used `create-react-app` package to generate a React application boilerplate. After discussing what React is, what it can and can not do, the group dived deeper into some of the fundamental concepts of React, `JSX`, `state`, `props`, and `lifecycle methods`. After exploring different React code samples, we developed a Job Board website using Github Jobs API. The code is available (MIT license) in our Github organization page for everyone to see and use. You can find it <a href="https://github.com/LACoders/JobBoard-React101" target="_blank">here</a>.

During our next meetups, we will dive deeper into the world of React and build more complex and cool stuff with it.
